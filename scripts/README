# Using the Level Editor

./python grideditor.py

Customize your own levels.
you don't need to put the border walls, the border walls will be included after your customization.

"P" - Player starting location
"#" - Wall/Platform
"E" - Exit
"T" - Collapsible Traps

Name your level and click "compress" and "export"

move the .data file to the levels directory

in the main.s :

add your new level_pointer to `level_pointers`, and add the line 
level_$
  incbin "your_level_$.data"

in data/constants.s,

add 1 to MAX_LEVELS so that the game can recognize the new number of levels by your addition.
